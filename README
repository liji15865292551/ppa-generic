PPA is an EL3 resident firmware for NXP QorIQ ARMv8 SoCs. It assists in core 
and platform initialization, provides standardized runtime services such as 
PSCI, and provides NXP-specific services.

For build help:
cd ppa
./build help

Example assuming gcc cross compiler from Ubuntu 16.04:
export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
./build rdb-fit all

The result of a build is a FIT image, e.g. ./soc-ls2088/build/obj/ppa.itb. 
It must be placed in flash or the firmware area of an SD card per board-specific
instructions.
